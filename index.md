## Research activity

_Focus on! :sparkles:_

Atomistic simulations encompass numerical methods that describe organizations and motions of atoms by considering only inter-atomic interaction effects. In material science and engineering, these computational methods are of uppermost importance to understand the behavior of materials at the atomic scale, thus enlightening experimental observations and drawing out physics based constitutive laws.
Our group strengths rely on molecular dynamics/statics methods with classical force-fields (EAM, polarized, etc.), as well as advanced related methods (NEB, continuum coupling, etc.). Advanced analysis technics are used on simulations input/output by using in-house codes and open-source programs. Quantum mechanics calculations (DFT, etc.) are also done in close collaborations with institutes  other academic collaborators.

Methods:

    Molecular dynamics (MD), Molecular statics (MS), Transition states (NEB)
    Tools / Code development
    High performance / large scale computing



### Research and Innovation (RD)

1. WindAfrica: internship to evaluate the potential of wind energy in Africa .
Africa has a crucial opportunity to leverage the North Sea’s huge potential for generating electricity from offshore wind turbines to advance both its clean energy transition and its leadership in clean energy technology manufacturing. And he highlighted that as the region where offshore wind was first developed, Africa should strive to remain a global leader in manufacturing the technologies needed for it as it seeks to strengthen its industrial competitiveness in the new energy economy.
1. FuelAfrica: internship on green fueling potential of the continent with country yearly review
EnergyAmbitionAfrica: Set climate and energy goals to achieve in the coming years for clean energy.
We regularly conduct in-depth peer reviews of the policies of our member countries to support their energy security and transitions. The latest ones examine the energy and climate policy landscapes in Africa and provide recommendations for how each can reinforce efforts to reach their goals.
1. EnergyEfficiencyAfrica:
More than 120 policy makers and energy professionals from 40 countries recently attended our energy efficiency training week in Paris to develop expertise in energy efficiency policy making, underlining the key role it can play in emerging economies. 
The IEA has been holding these week-long events since 2015, and we’ve trained more than 2,000 energy efficiency professionals from over 120 countries since then. The sessions are dedicated to sharing experiences and best practices for planning, implementing, and evaluating energy efficiency policies in emerging economies. By focusing on building policy-making capacity in these countries, the IEA aims to expand its community of energy efficiency practitioners that can implement effective policy, helping to unlock this potential. 
1. HydrogenAfrica:
Hydrogen energy for Africa.
Explore faisability,  policy and technology.

1. BatteriesAfrica
Electric cars, moto cycles with best battery ever.
